    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">You are not legally required to make your personal data available. Nevertheless, in
            order to close a user contract you must provide information such as your name and e-mail address. Without
            this information we are not able to enter into such a contract with you. Within the scope of the user
            contract, we are contractually obliged to keep the data provided in its precise and complete form for all
            applications used by you and for the entire duration of the contractual term. During the initial process of
            data entry we inform you if the provision of personal data is necessary for a particular feature or
            application (&quot;mandatory field&quot;). Where data is required, any failure to provide this information
            will result in the respective feature or application not being accessible to you the user. In the case of
            optional data, not making this information available may mean that our services cannot be provided in the

    <h2 class="c7" id="h.3u938667cw5s"><span class="c10 c6">1. General statement about the purposes of data
            processing</span></h2>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">The main reason we process personal data is to fulfil our contractual obligations
            towards our users. The processing of data is required, for example, for us to be able to suggest suitable
            contacts, services and information to you.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Operating a service like avni.club is subject to dynamic change by its very nature.
            It is not therefore possible to share every single detail about our data processing with you, but we do
            intend to inform you of all the key information. We process data first and foremost in order to fulfill our
            contractual obligations towards our users. In addition to this, we process your data to preserve our
            justifiable interests while taking your interests into account (e.g. when we send you promotional
            newsletters). And, of course, in some cases we are legally obliged to process data (e.g. to pass the data on
            to any investigative authorities). In all other cases we will ask for your separate consent to process your
            data (e.g. when using tracking technologies for the measurement and optimisation of advertising or when you
            enter a prize draw). When it comes to fulfilling our contractual obligations towards our users, we try to
            tailor our products and services to the needs of users at all times. Personalisation is important here.
            Interest and usage profiles are created. In order to be able to show you recommendations, e.g. for jobs,
            events, groups or contacts, and to suggest you as a valuable business contact or potential employee, we must
            have an idea of what your interests might be. In order to ascertain these interests we use information that
            you provide to us, in addition to implicit feedback, i.e. information that we automatically obtain through
            your usage of our service (by means of so-called &quot;tracking&quot;), as well as information that we may
            possibly receive indirectly (e.g. through a user&#39;s address book or upload). In order to meet our
            contractual obligations, we also serve you third-party advertising tailored to your needs and interests
            wherever possible. To this end, we provide advertisers with certain targeting criteria. Advertisers can
            state, for example, that they would like to target &quot;young people&quot; at places with &quot;1million
            citizens&quot;.</span></p>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Data about you is automatically collated by means of tracking while you visit or make
            use of the avni.club service. Here you can find out:</span></p>
    <h4 class="c0" id="h.tt8ib3lyt3xl"><span class="c3">How tracking works</span></h4>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Why tracking is used (ensuring security, provision of our service, measurement and
            optimisation of advertising, and determination of statistics). Data about you is automatically collated by
            means of tracking whenever you visit or make use of the avni.club service. This takes place with the help of
            various tracking technologies.</span></p>
    <h4 class="c0" id="h.c0nc9t15jfjc"><span class="c3">How does tracking work?</span></h4>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">In the so-called &quot;back end&quot;, at our web server level, we collect the data
            of logged-in users and other visitors, which we use first and foremost for the provision and preservation of
            the security of the service avni.club. In the &quot;front end&quot;, on your end device, we, or third
            parties we use, use cookies, pixels, local storage and similar tracking technologies to collect data about
            logged-in users and other visitors to enable the provision of our service and the analysis of user
            behaviour, and for the measurement and optimisation of advertising. In addition, we record your usage
            behaviour in connection with e-mails we send you, e.g. whether and when you have opened an e-mail, and which
            links you clicked on. Tracking involves the processing of login data (e.g. date and time of the visit,
            referrer, IP address, cookie ID, location data, product and version information about the browser or app
            used, device ID or data) and interaction data (e.g. pages viewed or searches carried out). In order to be
            able to identify you as a user during your visit to avni.club, we use so-called session cookies. These
            session cookies are automatically deleted at the end of a session. These cookies are required to be able to
            use avni.club. When you register you can choose to remain logged in. If you do, a cookie is then saved in
            the browser of your end device that means that you don&rsquo;t need to log in again for as long as the
            cookie remains saved. We also conduct a very approximate geo-localisation that informs us of the
            towns/cities you have been to. In order to do this we use your shorted and anonymised IP address, and your
            geo-coordinates if you have agreed to this on your mobile end device. We do not save your precise location.
            We only store information about which cities you are in on a regular basis. Specific addresses or
            geo-coordinates are not saved.</span></p>
    <h4 class="c0" id="h.ytmnoavl1st"><span class="c3">The purposes of tracking and your opt-out options</span></h4>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ensuring security One reason for tracking is to ensure and preserve the legitimate
            interest of the protection of users, the security of user data, avni.club Websites, and the avni.club
            service. To this end, we save the data we record for up to 90 days in its full form. Only a limited number
            of our employees with the respective authorisation rights have access to this data. The legal basis for this
            processing of personal data are Article 6 (1) f) and Article 32 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation
            (GDPR).</span></p>
    <h4 class="c0" id="h.ekrzormiseas"><span class="c3">Provision of our service</span></h4>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">We mainly use tracking and the associated user behaviour analysis to meet our
            contractual obligations and to perform pre-contractual measures. The legal basis for this processing of
            personal data is Article 6 (1) b) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). If tracking is not
            used to meet our contractual obligations or to perform pre-contractual measures, but to provide the service
            you visit or use, the legal basis for this processing is Article 6 (1) f) of the EU General Data Protection
            Regulation (GDPR). To this end, we pursue the legitimate interest of providing you with a smooth and
            user-friendly service.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Tracking and analysing user behaviour helps us to review and optimise the
            effectiveness of our service, and to identify and correct any errors and faults. To this end, we also use
            several services from third-party providers, such as Google. If we use third-party providers, data may be
            processed outside of the EU in so-called third countries where the level of data protection applied may not
            match EU standards. This means there is a risk that authorities in third countries may be able to access
            third-party provider data, possibly without any means of redress, for monitoring or surveillance purposes.
            We endeavour at all times to adapt our products and services to the needs of our users. Personalisation is
            an important aspect here. Analysing data obtained from tracking is necessary to make personalised services
            available to you in accordance with the contractual purpose of avni.club and to ensure that you gain the
            great possible benefit from avni.club The implicit feedback that you provide to us through our tracking of
            your usage of avni.club forms an important part of understanding what content you are more or less
            interested in, and being able to suggest you to other users as a valuable business contact or potential
            employee. This implicit feedback is enormously important as the information you provide to us is reflective
            of the past and the present for the most part, and says little about what interests you have with regard to
            the future. Interest profiles produced, for example, with the help of click data or searches you have
            conducted often form a better basis for estimating whether you, for example, are interested in finding a new
            job and what type of job openings you might be particularly interested in. When you delete your user account
            we delete or anonymise the personal data we have obtained through tracking in order to provide our
            service.</span></p>
    <h4 class="c0" id="h.4jptuhdqhymj"><span class="c3">Recommendations</span></h4>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Another important feature resulting from our analyses are recommendations that we
            tailor to you personally on the basis of your user data. We can, for example, recommend job offers, relevant
            news, events or interesting contacts to you.</span></p>
    <h4 class="c0" id="h.2nlodrpenpt9"><span class="c3">Personal statistics</span></h4>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">In order to be able to identify you as a valuable contact, we may show internal team
            information about your personal avni.club usage. This might include your level of user activity, the number
            of things you have in common with a respective profile visitor, events you have attended, the number times
            you have visited a advertiser&rsquo;s profile, how long you have been a member and what kind of membership
            you have.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">You can opt out of tracking by the following third-party providers: Google Analytics
            We use the tracking tool Google Analytics. Whenever you are logged in as a user on avni.club your data is
            matched with your user ID during the tracking process. If you are not logged in as a user, tracking is
            pseudonymous, i.e. we are not able to directly deduce information regarding your identity from information
            we obtain from tracking. The cookies used for the web analysis contain an ID which allows us to identify
            your end device&rsquo;s browser. We have closed a data processing agreement with the provider and your IP
            addresses are anonymised immediately after collection and personal data is processed within the European
            Union.</span></p>
    <h4 class="c0" id="h.ezhbnbp26hms"><span class="c3">Google Analytics</span></h4>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">We use the web analysis tool Google Analytics, developed by Google Inc.
            (&quot;Google&quot;). Google Analytics uses so-called &quot;cookies&quot;: text files that are saved on your
            computer and enable the analysis of your usage of a website. The information generated by the cookie about
            your use of this website (including your IP address) is transferred to a server of Google in the USA and
            saved there. We use the so-called &quot;_anonymizeIp()&quot; script here, which ensures that your IP address
            (after identifying the geolocation) is immediately anonymised by Google. We have also closed a data
            processing agreement with Google. Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to
            compile reports about website activity for website operators, and to provide other services relating to
            website and online usage. Google may also pass this information on to third parties if this is required by
            law or if these third parties process the data on behalf of Google. Google will not link your IP address to
            any other data about you it has stored.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c6">You can prevent the installation of cookies by adjusting the settings in your browser
            software accordingly; please note though that you may not be able to use all the features of the avni.club
            Websites in full as a result. Google also offers so-called deactivation tools for some web browsers, where
            you can opt out of your user behaviour being recorded and analysed. You will find more information and

            to post target-group-based online advertisements. To do so, we implemented a Twitter tag on our website.
            When you visit our websites, this tag creates a direct link to the Twitter servers so that Twitter knows you
            visited our websites and whether you performed any requests or similar. Twitter assigns this information to
            your personal Twitter user account. We are then able to serve (remarketing) advertisements based on your
            previous page views and activity. The data Twitter processes in this regard does not allow us to identify
            you. These pseudonyms are also not linked to any of your other personal data. To learn about your rights and

            We don&rsquo;t pass your personal data on to third parties, but we do when we are obliged to on legal
            grounds, by court order, or at the request of another official authority. In cases where we work together
            with external service providers for our data processing (e.g. in software development), this is usually
            carried out on an order processing basis, whereby we remain responsible for data processing. We review each

            protection and data security, thereby safeguarding the contractual provisions as stipulated by law for the
            protection of the personal data.</span></p>

            this automatic reminder from being sent by deleting the invitation in your settings. You also have the

    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">The aim of integrating external applications is to make avni.club more appealing and
            useful to users. API stands for Application Programming Interface, meaning that the avni.club API is an
            interface provided by us that allows API partners to integrate one or more applications on avni.club
            provided they adhere to our contractual terms. Users wishing to use an API Partner application must grant
            the application access to data; an API application of an API Partner can therefore only ever access data
            with the express allowance of the user. Depending on the application in question, a separate declaration of
            consent for data processing may be required. When API Partners process avni.club user data, this is
            performed on behalf of the user that activated the application. Every API Partner application that accesses
            the data and content of users requires our prior consent. avni.club has therefore compiled a list of
            criteria in order to ensure that the data of users is safe and secure. If an application involves personal
            data being processed in countries outside of the European Union, we will stipulate the legal privacy
            provisions required in order to ensure that API Partners maintain an appropriate level of protection for
            personal data.</span></p>

            card and bank details for the purpose of payment processing and invoicing in accordance with the method of
            payment you choose. Your payment details will be transferred, to the extent needed, along with other
            required data for processing the transaction, including invoicing and debt collection where applicable, to
            providers such as credit card institutes, payment providers and debt collection providers, and processed
            there, or the data will be collected directly by these providers. Your payment details are saved to enable
            payment processing and invoicing for the automatic extension of your user term.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Third countries Data may be transferred to third countries. This however shall always

            This does not require either an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45 of the EU GDPR or appropriate
            safeguards pursuant to Article 46 of the EU GDPR. In cases where the transfer of data to a third country
            does not serve the fulfilment of our contractual obligations, we have not received consent from you, the
            transfer is not necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, and no other exemption

            Article 45 of the EU GDPR or appropriate safeguards pursuant to Article 46 of the EU GDPR are in place. In
            general, we provide for appropriate safeguards by closing standard data protection clauses as decreed by the
            European Commission with the recipient body pursuant to Article 46 of the EU GDPR, as well as an adequate
            level of data protection. You can obtain copies of the EU standard data protection clauses on the Website of
